# InternshipRA
This repository was created with the intent of demonstrating the technical work done during my internship in Informatic Engineering in ISEC (Coimbra's Institute of Engineering) which took place from October 21st to March 21st. Most of this repository focuses on the code developed which lead to the final proof-of-concept.
